REGEX for getting RWYs (remove "s):  "[\n\r ]+RWY [0-9]+[RL]*-[0-9]+[RL]*[\n\r ]+"
FIELD ELEV is sometimes used.  Remember its index in case we're short.
This numbering is in order (kind of):
    -When reading by angle, they are in order by RWY name
     (8L,8R,9L,9R,10)
    -For Dallas, it appears that there is a slight ordering issue.
