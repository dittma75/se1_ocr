FAA OCR
This is a rapidly developed prototype of the airport diagram data parser for the FAA
around October 2014.  The project se1_ocr_implementation contains the final project,
which this prototype really doesn't represent.  This prototype was developed entirely
by me, whereas the real project was a group effort to which I contributed the
regular expression parsing of the text, the conversion of the diagram into text
and image representations, and parts of the image parsing methods.
